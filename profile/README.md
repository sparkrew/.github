## Welcome to the software performing arts research krew 👋

🙋‍♀️ The krew does software research at the intersection of the software supply chain and generative art. 

🎭 We operate at the Université de Montréal in the computer science departement, a.k.a, [DIRO](https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/). 

🎛️ We often perform with [Assert](https://github.com/ASSERT-KTH), from KTH in Stockholm, Sweden
